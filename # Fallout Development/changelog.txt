# Changelog
#-----------------------------
- NCR now uses a shogunate-style setup, where Shady Sands is the shogun and the various territories are daimyos. This better mirrors the situation the NCR faces in lore, where it provides protection but isn't unified in policy.
- Unify the Republic is available to NCR states too, allowing them to form the NCR.
- Changed Disasters terminology into Incidents, to allow for non-negative usage.
- Caesar's Legion now gets an unique incident: Unity of Caesar. This provides massive bonuses to represent the unity Caesar achieved amoungst the tribes. Once he is dead, this is removed.
- Added The Confederacy as a nation in Alabama.
- Added Confederate NIs.
- Added Colonial Restrictions triggered modifier, limiting colonial range unless you have over 500 development.
- Added decision for neighboring states to request admission into the NCR.
