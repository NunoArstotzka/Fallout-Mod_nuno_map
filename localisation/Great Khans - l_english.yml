 great_khans.1.title: "Chances Map"
 great_khans.1.desc: "During the job to escort Benny on his trip to whack the Courier and obtain an otherwise unremarkable package, a long time Great Khan member (Chance) died. His death followed a brave fight where he charged a flamer wielding raider who invoked memories of the Bitter Springs massacre in the traumatized veteran.\n\nBefore his death, him and the other Khans drew a map based off the Khans comprehension of the Mojave, demonstrating a comprehension of the terrain and map that few in Nevada share. Utilizing this knowledge, the Khans can effectively shift drug shipments around and follow less travelled roads in its future battles."
 great_khans.1.option.a: "Understood"
 
 great_khans.2.title: "Benny's Betrayal" 
 great_khans.2.desc: "The worlds of New Vegas and the tribes united in a rare job offering from Benny, the head of the Tops Casino. Whilst the Great Khans are not willing to be hitmen for New Vegas, the opportunity to take a simple escort job with a large payout was too good to turn down.\n\nOnce Benny had what he wanted, he abandoned his Great Khan escorts, allowing them to get surrounded by the NCR. Whilst the Great Khans stood off in a tense standoff with the NCR, Benny was living it up in the penthouse."
 great_khans.2.option.a: "Truth is, it was rigged from the beginning"
 
 great_khans.3.title: "Fiends Raid Drug Caravan" 
 great_khans.3.desc: "Rampaging Fiends have raided one of our chem peddling caravans. This violates the trust that has been built up between the two factions who have overseen the growth of the drug trade within the area of New Vegas. \n\nWe could halt our drug trade with them which should apply enough pressure to force them into line or we could just assume they mistook us for some other non-affiliated traders."
 great_khans.3.option.a: "Hit them where it hurts!"
 great_khans.3.option.b: "Forgive them"
