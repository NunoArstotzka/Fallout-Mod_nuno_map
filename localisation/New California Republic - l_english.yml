 ncr.1.title: "Future of the NCR"
 ncr.1.desc: "Skirmishes with Caesar's Legion occur daily, and tensions are high on the frontier.\n\nSome say war will soon be upon us. The time to focus is now, and what we choose may dictate our future for years to come."
 ncr.1.option.a: "Focus on the Mojave"
 ncr.1.option.b: "Focus on Shady Sands"
 
 ncr.2.title: "The Ranger Unification Treaty" 
 ncr.2.desc: "In 2271 the Desert Rangers and the NCR signed a treaty effectively annexing the Rangers in return for extending NCR law and manpower across the portions of Nevada. Despite the relative success of the treaty, there are concerns that the Rangers culture is preventing the spread of Californians to the frontier."
 ncr.2.option.a: "The Rangers ARE the republic!"
 ncr.2.option.b: "Phase the treaty out" 
 
 ncr.3.title: "Collapse of the Ranger Unification Treaty"
 ncr.3.desc: "With the loss of the Mojave Outpost, our connection to the Desert Rangers has collapsed. Although many remain in our army, much more see our failure in Nevada as the end of the treaty. As our reliance on each other ends, savages tear down the Unification statue and celebrate at its demise."
 ncr.3.option.a: "The republic will endure" 

 ncr.4.title: "Economic Sabotage"
 ncr.4.desc: "Our war with the Lost Hills Brotherhood Chapter has taken a turn for the worse after the Brotherhood conducted precision strikes against economically important gold mines. \n\nThe cowardly act replicates the events of the last NCR-Brotherhood war where the Brotherhood caused significant economic damage to California’s economy. \n\nThe ripple effect caused by this strike will cause significant damage to both our economy and currency controls."
 ncr.4.option.a: "We will have our revenge!"

 ncr.5.title: "NCR Gold Recovery Act"
 ncr.5.desc: "With the support of the senators, we have passed a bill to restore the Great Wanamingo Mine to its former glory. \n\nThis change should offer significant benefits for the country and express our steadfast resilience against the Brotherhood menace!"
 ncr.5.option.a: "A good day for all Californians"

 # Los Angeles

 los_angeles.1.title: "Boneyard Library Flourishes"
 los_angeles.1.desc: "Despite a decline in relations between the Followers and the NCR in recent years, Boneyard Library has beaten the odds to become one of the foremost centres of education and research in the wastes.\n\nAs well as this, they are very popular amongst poor communities benefiting from their assistance. Maybe cooperation with the Followers would be good for us."
 los_angeles.1.option.a: "With our resources and their knowledge, we could gain a lot!"
 los_angeles.1.option.b: "But they still won't join us; we need to only strengthen ourselves!"
