Unleash their potential, and see the Ghouls tremble before us."

They cannot say this aloud, for 'culture' and 'tolerance' bids them silent, but they  know the truth. Here at the Ghoul Haters, we proclaim that truth with fury. Let all Ghoul Haters from everywhere enter our lands and be trained to fight. We've yet to run out of reinforcements!"
