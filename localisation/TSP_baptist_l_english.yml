 baptist_convention: "Baptist Convention"
 baptist_convention_desc: "A Baptist Convention is an autocephalous, autonomous, and voluntary hiearchy of Baptist churches. \nAutocephaly (literally meaning "self-headed") refers to a decentralized church structure, where churches answer to regional, independent clergy. Of every Christian denomination on the earth, none are as extreme as the Baptists when it comes to the belief in autocephaly. Baptists are obligated to submit to only one shepherd, and that is their elected pastor and elected deaconate (or eldership, or both).\n Baptists take Congregationalism to a similar extreme, in which all clergy, all lay staff, and all committeemen are either elected directly or appointed by elected peers. Other than the traditional Protestant creeds of Sola Scriptura (etc.), the use of non-alcoholic grape juice ("new wine"), and the mandate of adult baptism, there is no official, universally orthodox Baptist doctrine on any other subject. Baptist churches instead freely associate with voluntary Baptist Conventions, which enforce agreed-upon doctrine on their members and coordinate charity work and missionary prolestyzation."

 baptist.1.title: "Baptist Autocephaly"
 baptist.1.desc: "With the official adoption of the Baptist denomination of Christianity, your nation must now conform to the Baptist orthodoxy. This means that your church hiearchy now becomes voluntary- on paper, at least -and your provinces develop tremendous autonomy, as smaller associations of churches now govern locally. With your hands tied to the legislative body of churches, you now give up your dreams of absolutism and assume your position as chairman of the newly minted Baptist Convention. Most importantly, your office is now elected!"
 baptist.1.a: "Amen."
 baptist.1.b: "I will not relenquish my authority as $MONARCHTITLE$!"
 baptist.2.title: "Baptist Autocephaly Ends"
 baptist.2.desc: "Our nation has abandoned the teachings of Baptist Christianity and, as such, is no longer beholden to the fleeting whims of local churches and a legislative body. As such, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has been unanimously declared the head clergyman of a compulsory hiearchy by all non-Baptists present at the final assembly, with equally unanimous Baptist opposition. Hail the divinely appointed $MONARCH$!"
