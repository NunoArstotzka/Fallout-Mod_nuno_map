 gov_wolf: "Wolf Pack"
 gov_wolf: "This is the cosmopolitan, egalitarian, meritocratic, and bloodthirsty command hiearchy of the Pack. Loyal to a fault, the Pack consists of the meanest sons of dogs east of the Legion! The ruler of the Pack is called the Alpha, and exercises absolute authority. Taking its nature from wolves and Mongrels, this state emphasizes survival of the fittest, violence, and enslavement. However, individual members of the Pack are actually a tight-knit, caring group (for each other). The laws of the Pack prohibit the Alpha from executing any members and, as such, the main punishment is banishment. \n Here in the Pack, any man may rise to become the Alpha, not by blood or money, but by sheer skill and competency. All cultures accepted by the Pack are eligible to be the Alpha. Any Pack member may challenge the Alpha for dominance, but traditionally, the Alpha serves for life."
