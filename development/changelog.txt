# 1.06
- Reworked Nukes. You now start a Nuclear Weapons programme at MIL tech 20 and experience random events that will simulate the process of creating a warhead. You will get occassional negative events whilst this is active, although eventually you will get a nuke. You can end the programme if you have enough nukes and/or you don't want to experience the negative events anymore.
- Changed the effect of Nukes. Now empties the province (unless it is a capital) and adds the Nuked! modifiers to itself and 3 neighbor provinces. Adds 100 local autonomy and devastation, and changes the trade good to Radioactive Waste.
- Changed the internal government types back to the four vanilla uses. This is to allow for more sensible switching.
- Changed the base reforms to allow for early switching of the basic forms with a government type in Tier 1 (i.e. Settlement to Militia for Republic types).
- Adjusted the government reforms so there are 5 tiers. Locked a few reforms behind new requirements.
- Added government reforms that let you change the overall government type (at Tier 5).
- Added a government reform that clears special government types, letting those with them change to a new government (at Tier 5).
