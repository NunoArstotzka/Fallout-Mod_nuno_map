# 1.06
- Reworked Nukes. You now start a Nuclear Weapons programme at MIL tech 20 and experience random events that will simulate the process of creating a warhead. You will get occassional negative events whilst this is active, although eventually you will get a nuke. You can end the programme if you have enough nukes and/or you don't want to experience the negative events anymore.
- Changed the effect of Nukes. Now empties the province (unless it is a capital) and adds the Nuked! modifiers to itself and 3 neighbor provinces. Adds 100 local autonomy and devastation, and changes the trade good to Radioactive Waste.
